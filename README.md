# Practicing Documentation & Style in Python

Prerequisite: install pylint, for example:

    conda install pylint

## Exercise 1: Style

Run pylint on `style_demo.py`, eg:

	pylint style_demo.py

Use an editor (nano, VS code, or similar) to get it to at least 8/10 by addressing style issues (ignore documentation-related issues for now).

# Exercise 2: Documentation

Run pylint on `style_demo.py`, eg:

	pylint style_demo.py

Use an editor (nano, VS code, or similar) to get it to at least 10/10 by addressing documentation issues.
